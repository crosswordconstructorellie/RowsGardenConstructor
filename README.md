Rows Garden Constructor
This is my attempt to create an improved Rows Garden Constructor with increased features and capabilities.
I was inspired by [this one created by Crossword Nexus](https://crosswordnexus.github.io/variety-tools/rows-garden/).

## What Already Exists
The Crossword Nexus tool creates a Rows Garden puzzle based on your initial input of the first line or lines. 

## My Goals
1. I aim to develop a "Bloom Checker and Generator." Blooms are the 6-letter hexagons that make up a Rows Garden puzzle. 
A Bloom Checker/Generator feature should be able to take a 6-letter string using up to 6 letters with wildcards "?" replacing any missing letters.
This feature would allow users to take partially filled blooms and generate options to complete them. It would also allow a user to check if a given string of six letters in order can be read from any starting letter in either direction to create a real word.
2. I also aim to create an autofill generator that can suggest ways to fill the rest of a row or entire puzzle based on existing entries at any place in the puzzle.
